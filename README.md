# Gundam Oscillation Analysis Toolkit

This is a set of tools used to put together an oscillation analysis using the GUNDAM (Generalized Unified Neutrino Data Analysis Method).  The primary (and initial) target for the tool kit is the DUNE experiment, but it aims to be applicable to any experiment.  The initial direction is towards PNMS analyses.  

# Using the tool kit

The tool kit depends on the GUNDAM software (add link), and provides the applications specific tools needed for an oscillation analysis.
