# Example: Using Prob3PlusPlus to Tabulate Oscillations

This is a simple example of how to use a oscillation weight calculation with GUNDAM.  This example is based on Prob3PlusPlus https://github.com/rogerwendell/Prob3plusplus.git, but the basic principles should apply.

Compiling this code:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

That will grab the Prob3plusplus repository from Roger's github, build it, and then build the libTabulatedProb3PlusPlus.so file that can be included in GUNDAM.
